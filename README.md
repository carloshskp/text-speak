# Text Reader 🎙️

A modern and responsive web application that converts text to speech, allowing users to hear any text aloud with full control over playback speed.

## ✨ Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert any text to audio using the browser's native Web Speech API
- **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed from 0.5x to 2.0x for your convenience
- **Modern Interface**: Clean and responsive design with attractive visual gradient
- **Data Persistence**: Save text in the browser for later access
- **Play and Pause**: Full control over playback with intuitive buttons
- **Brazilian Portuguese Support**: Automatic detection and selection of pt-BR voices when available
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Mobile-friendly Controls**: Buttons and slider reorganize on viewports up to 360 px without overflowing the container

## 🎨 Branding

- The official application logo is available at [`assets/logo.svg`](assets/logo.svg) and is used as the in-app badge and site favicon.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Type or paste the text you want to hear in the text field
3. Click the **Play** button (▶) to start reading
4. Use the slider to adjust the playback speed (0.5x to 2.0x)
5. Click the **Pause** button (⏸) to pause playback
6. Click the **Save** button (💾) to save the text in your browser

## 📋 Requirements

- Modern browser with Web Speech API support
- JavaScript enabled
- Internet connection (to load CDN dependencies)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Styles with backdrop-filter and gradient support
- **JavaScript**: Application logic
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Inline SVG Icons**: Lucide icons embutidos diretamente no markup (sem dependências externas)
- **Web Speech API**: Native browser speech synthesis

## 📦 Dependencies

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - via CDN

## 📈 Analytics & Privacy

- Google Analytics (GA4) and Google Tag Manager now load from the deferred [`analytics.js`](analytics.js) file instead of inline snippets.
- The script waits for `requestIdleCallback` or the first user interaction (click, key press, pointer/touch) before injecting GA/GTM assets, freeing the critical rendering path while keeping telemetry intact.
- The GTM `<noscript>` iframe remains in the `<body>` to preserve baseline tracking for users without JavaScript.
- If your deployment requires explicit consent, set `window.APP_ANALYTICS_AUTO_START = false` in a script that runs before `analytics.js` and call `window.appAnalytics.init()` once consent is granted (or `window.appAnalytics.enableAutoStart()` to re-enable the deferred behaviour).
- After deploying, validate that GA/GTM receive events (e.g., GTM preview mode or GA real-time dashboard) and rerun the PageSpeed Insights test to compare results with the previous baseline.

## 💾 Local Storage

The application saves text in the browser's `localStorage`, allowing you to easily retrieve your content on future visits.

## 📊 PageSpeed Insights

- **Última medição (2025-11-12)**: tentativa de execução via PageSpeed Insights bloqueada pelo ambiente (resposta HTTP 403). Recomendamos repetir o teste em um ambiente conectado para capturar métricas atualizadas após a remoção dos ícones externos.

## 🎯 Available Voices

The application automatically tries to select a Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR) voice if available on your system. If no pt-BR voice is found, the browser will use the system's default voice.

## 🌐 Supported Browsers

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (version 25+)
- ✅ Firefox (version 49+)
- ✅ Safari (version 14.1+)
- ✅ Edge (version 79+)
- ⚠️ Opera (with partial support)

## 📝 Notes

- Voice quality depends on the voices available on your operating system
- Some browsers may have limitations on text length for speech synthesis
- Playback speed may vary depending on the browser and operating system
- Ícones são renderizados inline como SVG, eliminando a dependência do CDN do Lucide

## 💖 Donation Modal

- The PIX donation QR code now lives at [`assets/qr-code.svg`](assets/qr-code.svg) and is only requested when the donation modal opens for the first time via a lazily loaded `<img>` tag, keeping the initial HTML payload lean.
- A lightweight placeholder with fixed dimensions (`192x192`) prevents layout shifts before the QR code loads.
- The modal was validated on mobile viewports (Chrome DevTools responsive mode) to ensure the QR code loads and remains accessible on touch devices.

## 💡 Usage Tips

- Use slower speeds (0.5x - 1.0x) for better comprehension
- Use faster speeds (1.5x - 2.0x) for quick review
- Save frequently used texts for quick access
- Test different voices on your system to find the one that works best

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Voice is not working
- Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try reloading the page
- Make sure your browser has permission to use speech synthesis

### Save button is disabled
- The Save button only becomes enabled after starting playback
- Check that there is available space in your browser's local storage

### Text is not read completely
- Some browsers have a text length limit for speech synthesis
- Try dividing the text into smaller parts
